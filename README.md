Valentine's Day card in **Java** using the **libGDX** library.

Main characteristics:
* Hearts fly in a random order, mostly upward.
* They don’t fly into the central zone, they rest and fly around.
* The interaction is simple - tracking the position of the mouse and clicks - changes in the direction of movement occur.
For clarity, it is better to click and move many times.
  
Application is built and packaged to [jar](ValentinesDayPoster.jar)
